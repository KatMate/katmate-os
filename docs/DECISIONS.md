# Architecture Decision Records

Format: context → decision → consequences. Status: **Accepted**, **Proposed**
(open question under evaluation), or **Superseded**. Open questions enter as
Proposed and are promoted on decision. Dates are approximate where
reconstructed; backfill from git history where it matters.

## ADR-001 — Compartmentalization via QEMU/KVM MicroVMs, not Xen

**Status:** Accepted (project inception)

**Context:** Qubes OS proves the compartmentalization model but carries the
Xen ecosystem: heavy stack, Fedora-centric tooling, demanding UX aimed at
power users.

**Decision:** Standard Linux stack — QEMU/KVM MicroVMs on an Arch host, with
broad-user usability as a first-class goal.

**Consequences:** Simpler codebase, easier kernel experimentation, wider
hardware support. We give up the mature Qubes ecosystem (qrexec, gui-daemon)
and must build our own template, agent and policy layers.

## ADR-002 — Arch Linux host, Debian stable guests

**Status:** Accepted (project inception)

**Context:** The host is a developer-facing TCB; guests are user-facing
appliances.

**Decision:** Arch for the host (fresh, flexible, pacman ecosystem); Debian
stable for guests (stability, predictable backports, ABI stability, small
footprint).

**Consequences:** Two package ecosystems to manage; version skew between them
must be handled explicitly (see ADR-008).

---

## ADR-003 — AF_VSOCK as the only host↔guest channel

**Status:** Accepted (v0.1)

**Context:** Any network channel between host and guest expands the attack
surface and complicates firewalling.

**Decision:** All control, file transfer and GUI traffic crosses AF_VSOCK
exclusively. No TCP between host and guests; no guest-to-guest channel.

**Consequences:** vm-agent and waypipe must speak vsock; the firewall story
stays trivial (vsock bypasses netfilter); inter-VM data flow only via the host.

---

## ADR-004 — Host kernel: `linux-hardened` from the Arch repo

**Status:** Accepted (2026)

**Context:** The host is the TCB and benefits from hardening, but a custom
host kernel is a permanent maintenance burden. `linux-hardened` is maintained
in the Arch repo with pacman integration.

**Decision:** `linux-hardened` as the host kernel. A custom host kernel is
justified only if a hard requirement appears that hardened cannot satisfy —
in that case: Arch LTS sources + `katmate-host.config` delta, maintained in git.

**Consequences:** io_uring is disabled (`kernel.io_uring_disabled = 2`) →
QEMU launch scripts use `aio=threads` instead of `aio=io_uring`.
Suspend/resume currently regresses on one development machine (under
investigation — see [state.md](../state.md)). Hardening sysctls may surface
further incompatibilities; each gets recorded here.

## ADR-005 — Guest kernel: custom build from Debian LTS sources

**Status:** Accepted (2026)

**Context:** Guests are appliances. A rolling guest kernel would mean a
potentially broken guest on any update — unacceptable for the broad-user UX
goal.

**Decision:** Custom MicroVM-optimized kernel built from Debian LTS sources
(`vmlinuz-katmate-microvm-amd64-6.12.x`): virtio-blk/net/vsock, ext4, tmpfs,
namespaces, cgroups; fast boot, low memory, minimal config surface.

**Consequences:** Kernel updates ride Debian security backports and are
shipped via base image rebuilds (ADR-007); high ABI stability for modules.

---

## ADR-006 — systemd-boot instead of GRUB

**Status:** Accepted (installer v0.3 rewrite)

**Context:** GRUB (used through v0.1) is heavyweight for a single-entry,
UEFI-only appliance boot path.

**Decision:** systemd-boot with `timeout 0` and `editor no` — boot straight
into the OS, no interactive kernel command-line editing.

**Consequences:** UEFI-only (acceptable: all reference hardware is UEFI);
simpler boot chain; docs and installer verification updated accordingly.

---

## ADR-007 — Versioned immutable base image + per-AppVM overlays

**Status:** Accepted (2026)

**Context:** Users must never administer templates, kernels or forwarding
components. System updates must not endanger user data.

**Decision:** Immutable, versioned base image (`katmate-base-YYYYMMDD.img`)
containing OS + kernel + waypipe + vm-agent; AppVM overlays carry user data
only. `katmate-update` detects host/base version mismatches (triggered by a
pacman hook on the host) and rebuilds the base; overlays are recycled onto the
new base. The user receives a notification, no action required.

**Consequences:** Reproducible base builds become mandatory (pipeline:
ADR-011); strict system/data separation; update logic centralizes in one tool.

---

## ADR-008 — Waypipe version-locked host↔guest; guest builds from source

**Status:** Accepted (2026)

**Context:** Host (Arch) shipped waypipe 0.11.0, guest (Debian stable) 0.9.2.
The version skew produced a compression negotiation mismatch
(`header has 100 != own 200`) — refused connections and SIGSEGV crashes on
clipboard operations.

**Decision:** The guest builds waypipe from source, pinned to the host
version. Build gotchas (recorded so they stay solved): waypipe ≥ 0.11 is
partly Rust; `bindgen` is required or the lz4/zstd feature gates silently
resolve to `false`; the build wrapper passes `--frozen`, so `cargo fetch` must
run before `meson setup`. Recipe lives in
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#guest-waypipe-build-part-of-the-base-image-pipeline).

**Consequences:** Waypipe becomes a version-locked base image component;
`katmate-update` enforces the lock (ADR-007). Clipboard guest↔host functional
since.

---

## ADR-009 — NetVM as the sole network-facing domain

**Status:** Accepted as target architecture (implementation: v0.3)

**Context:** Today WireGuard terminates on the host, which contradicts the
isolation model — the TCB carries the VPN and the network-facing surface.

**Decision:** A dedicated NetVM owns DHCP, DNS, VPN, firewalling and routing.
AppVMs receive connectivity exclusively through it. Host-side VPN is an
explicitly transitional state.

**Consequences:** Requires networking automation (v0.3); the migration path
must be kept documented so the transitional state does not fossilize.

---

## ADR-010 — Storage formalization for base images and overlays

**Status:** Proposed

**Question:** Exact mechanism and placement: qcow2 overlays with base image
backing (current direction) vs overlayfs vs raw thin LVs throughout; where the
image store lives relative to the thin pool. Current working split: qcow2 root
overlays for AppVMs, raw thin LVs for persistent home data.

---

## ADR-011 — Base image build pipeline tooling

**Status:** Proposed

**Question:** Script vs Makefile vs higher-level tooling (e.g. ansible) for
reproducible base image builds. Bias per development philosophy: simplest
thing that is fully scripted and diffable.

---

## ADR-012 — Base image distribution model

**Status:** Proposed

**Question:** Local build on every machine vs centrally built and distributed
images for end users. Interacts with ADR-013 (signing) and the
reproducibility principle.

---

## ADR-013 — Base image signing & integrity verification

**Status:** Proposed

**Question:** Signature scheme and verification point for base images
(mandatory if ADR-012 lands on central distribution; useful even for local
builds as tamper evidence).
